# NBA Player Performance
>This NBA Player Performance project involves scraping data from the internet, cleaning and analyzing the data, building a predictive model, and deploying it as a web application. The goal of the project is to use historical data to make predictions about future player performance.

## Steps

- First step is to scrape data from websites that contain information on NBA players, teams, and games. This data is then cleaned and transformed to remove any missing or irrelevant data, and to prepare it for analysis.

- Second step is to analyze the clean data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques such as data visualization, descriptive statistics, and correlation analysis. This helps to understand the distribution and relationships within the data and identify patterns and trends.

- Step three, after EDA, a machine learning model is built using the data. The model is trained on a portion of the data and then tested on a separate portion to evaluate its performance. Hyperparameter tuning is done to fine-tune the model's parameters.

- Step four, the model is deployed as a web application, which allows users to input data and receive predictions from the model.
